**Fluid-Fabric Coupling with Surface-Tension Contact**

Target
=========================
The main focus of our work is to establish a coupling model between fluid and Cloth while incorporating fluid surface tension into our model.

We aim to enhance the cloth simulation technique, built upon the foundation of libWetCloth, by transitioning to a finite element method (FEM). This modification will enable us to achieve a more accurate depiction of fluid infiltration within the fabric environment. The key advantage of FEM lies in its ability to offer enhanced control over cloth vertices, including the manipulation of fluid particles, as well as a more comprehensive representation of their diffusion within the fabric mesh.

In the context of fluid simulation, we aim to adopt the APIC (Affine Particle-in-Cell) method, as mentioned by libWetCloth, as our primary approach. Furthermore, we will incorporate the FLIP method as an alternative technique to facilitate a comparative analysis. This is particularly relevant for simulating scenarios involving highly fragmented water droplets.
